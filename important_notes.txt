run the initialize.sh script that will make sure to give the correct permissions
it has to be run in super user mode as it changes permission
sudo ./initialize.sh

run the "docker-compose up -d" of postgres first in:
 ./postgres_accidents_datasets
run the "docker-compose up -d" of airflow after:
 ./airflow

Here you can see the UI interfaces:
PgAdmin UI: localhost:8081
Airflow UI: localhost:8080
DashBoard: localhost:8055

if the DAG is not triggered, it should be triggered manually in the web interface at:
 Airflow UI: localhost:8080

note:
 - we have 2 csv files in ./airflow/data folder because we perform the ‘extraction of additional data task’.
 - changing airflow directory name to airflow_milestone3 poses problems in the airflow compose file related to the python version for some reason,
   therefore we opted to not rename the folder
